# PNPscript
PNPscript - ProdigyPNP's upcoming programming language, designed for hacking Prodigy.

THIS IS IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT. DON'T BOTHER TRYING TO ACTUALLY LIKE USE THIS RN

## Why PNPscript?
First of all, it should let us, Alphas of ProdigyPNP, quickly prototype ideas for new hacks without... doing the webpack _every time_.

Also, maybe skids could write their own hacks instead of constantly bugging us?
